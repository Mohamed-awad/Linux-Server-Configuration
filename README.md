# Linux-Server-Configuration-UDACITY

This is the seven project for "Full Stack Web Developer Nanodegree" on Udacity.

In this project, a Linux virtual machine needs to be configurated to support the Item Catalog website.

You can visit http://127.0.0.1 for the website deployed.

# the SSh Key the SSH key you created for the grader user :-
01111451253
# the password for grader login :-
M+e=2018 

# Tasks :-


  1-  Launch your Virtual Machine with your Udacity account
  2-  Follow the instructions provided to SSH into your server
  3-  Create a new user named grader
  4-  Give the grader the permission to sudo
  5-  Update all currently installed packages
  6-  Change the SSH port from 22 to 2200
  7-  Configure the Uncomplicated Firewall (UFW) to only allow incoming connections for SSH (port 2200),
      HTTP (port 80), and NTP (port 123)
  8-  Configure the local timezone to UTC
  9-  Install and configure Apache to serve a Python mod_wsgi application
  10-  Install and configure PostgreSQL:
  *   Do not allow remote connections
  *     Create a new user named catalog that has limited permissions to your catalog application database
  11-  Install git, clone and setup your Catalog App project (from your GitHub repository from earlier in the Nanodegree program) so that it functions correctly when visiting your serverâ€™s IP address in a browser. Remember to set this up appropriately so that your .git directory is not publicly accessible via a browser!


# Create a new user named grader

    sudo adduser grader
    vim /etc/sudoers
    touch /etc/sudoers.d/grader
    vim /etc/sudoers.d/grader, type in grader ALL=(ALL:ALL) ALL, save and quit

# Set ssh login using keys

    generate keys on local machine usingssh-keygen ; then save the private key in ~/.ssh on local machine

    deploy public key on developement enviroment

    On you virtual machine:

    $ su - grader
    $ mkdir .ssh
    $ touch .ssh/authorized_keys
    $ vim .ssh/authorized_keys

    Copy the public key generated on your local machine to this file and save

    $ chmod 700 .ssh
    $ chmod 644 .ssh/authorized_keys

    reload SSH using service ssh restart

    now you can use ssh to login with the new user you created

    ssh -i [privateKeyFilename] grader@52.24.125.52

# Update all currently installed packages

sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get upgrade

# Change the SSH port from 22 to 2200

    Use sudo vim /etc/ssh/sshd_config and then change Port 22 to Port 2200 , save & quit.
    Reload SSH using sudo service ssh restart

# Configure the Uncomplicated Firewall (UFW)

Configure the Uncomplicated Firewall (UFW) to only allow incoming connections for SSH (port 2200), HTTP (port 80), and NTP (port 123)

sudo ufw allow 2200/tcp
sudo ufw allow 80/tcp
sudo ufw allow 123/udp
sudo ufw enable
